- 👋 Hi, I’m @linux-adventurer
- 👀 I’m interested in all things tech, and exploring linux and cyber security
- 🌱 I’m currently learning linux, coding, cybersecurity, and French.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really, but even though I have been studying coding for the past 2 years I am still very bad at it.
- 📫 How to reach me currently working on this.
